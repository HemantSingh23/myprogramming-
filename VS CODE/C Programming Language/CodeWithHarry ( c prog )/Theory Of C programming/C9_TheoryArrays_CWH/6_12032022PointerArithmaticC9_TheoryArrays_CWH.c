/*

Pointer Arithmetic ::

A pointer can be incremented to point to the next memory location of that type.



Consider these example :

Ex.1 

int i = 32;
int *a = &i;    ==> a =87994 (address = 87994)  // address of i  = 87994
a++;            ==> now a = 87998



Ex.2

char a = 'A';
char *b = &a;   ==> b = 87994
b++;            ==> now b = 87995



Ex.3

float i = 1.7;
float*a = &i;   ==> Address of i or a = 87994
a++;            ==> Now a = 87998





Following operations can be performed on pointers:

Addition of a number to a pointer.
Subtraction of a number from a pointer
Subtraction of one pointer from another
Comparison of two pointer variables
