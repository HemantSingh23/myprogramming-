/*       What is Recursion ?   
A Function  defined in C can call itself. This is called recursion.
A function calling itself is also called Recursive Function. 

//            Recursion = function ke andar same vhi function   

Example of Recursion:-

A very good example of the Recursion is Factorial.

factorial(n) = 1x 2 x 3...........x n
factorial(n)= 1 x 2 x 3...........n-1 x n
factorial(n)= factorial of (n-1) x n  

Since we can write factorial of a number in terms of itself, we can program it using recursion.      */

#include<stdio.h>             // PLEASE ALSO READ THE LAST LINES

int factorial (int x);

    if(x==1 || x==0)
    {
        return 1;

    else
    {
        return x * factorial(x-1) ; 
    }

/*  How does it Works ?

factorial(5)        // factorial 5  phle 5 aur factorial 4 me jayega uske baad same factorial 4 bhi hoga jaisa neche diya hai

5 x factorial(4)

5 x 4 x factorial(3)

5 x 4 x 3 x factorial(2)

5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x factorial(1)

5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1  


IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. Recursion is sometimes the most direct way to code an algorithm

2. The condition which doesnâ€™t call the function any further in a recursive function is called the base condition.

3. Sometimes, due to a mistake made by the programmer, a recursive function can keep running without returning, 
   resulting in a memory error.
