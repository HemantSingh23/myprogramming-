/* 
Types of Functions:

1. Library functions: Commonly required functions grouped together in a library file on disk.
   ex. printf

2. User-defined functions: These are the functions declared and defined by the user.
   ex. goodMorning , display , goodnight  etc. 



Why use functions?  

1. To avoid rewriting the same logic again and again
2. To keep track of what we are doing in a program
3. To test and check logic independently   




Passing values to functions:-

We can pass values to a function and can get a value in return from a function
int sum(int a, int b)

 The above prototype means that sum is a function which takes values a (of type int) and 
 b (of type int) and returns the  value (of type int) .



THE FUNCTION WHICH TAKES THE VALUE IS CALLED  "PARAMETER"  .
ex. in the above definition a, b are called PARAMETER .

AND THE FUNCTION WHICH GIVES  THE VALUE IS CALLED  "RETURN VALUE"  . 
ex. in the above definition int(which is written befor sum) is called RETURN VALUE .
